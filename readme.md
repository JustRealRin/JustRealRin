**Thank you** for cloning, forking, or starring my project!

I used to work in cybersecurity and am currently unemployed. In this situation, I want to use whatever limited knowledge and skills I have to **help** others, even if it’s only a very small contribution.

I’m just an **ordinary person**—there are many things I don’t do well and a lot I don’t fully understand.

I’m especially not good at writing code, so my code is fairly ordinary at best and sometimes lacking in logical structure.

Compared to coding, I learn command‐line controls much more quickly, so I’m probably better suited to network system administration and maintenance.

**I welcome any suggestions**—good or bad—about my project. **All feedback is appreciated**.

I hope to **learn** from and **grow** with more friends.

If you have any questions, feel free to open an **issue** on GitHub.
